# sqlalchemy-challenge

I've decided to treat myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with trip planning, I need to do some climate analysis on the area.
First I used Python and SQLAlchemy to perform basic climate analysis and data exploration of my climate database.

# Project structure
```
project 
|__ .gitignore          # gitignore file
|__ climate_starter.ipynb  # data cleaned and analysis
|__ app.py                  # flask app
| 
|__ Resources/          # contains raw data and sql database
|   |__ hawaii_measurement.csv         # raw data
|   |__ hawaii_stations.csv     # raw data
|   |__ hawaii.sqlite     # SQL database

```
